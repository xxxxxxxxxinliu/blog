I have wanted to make a blog for a long time, but it turned out to be more complicated than I initially thought. Because i did not want to use any commercial platform that makes a profit on my content, i decided to build this simple site with Jekyll. It was a bit struggle this morning, but here we are.

This is not going to be much a professional related blog post and i am not hoping people to take this seriously. However, making it "public" through the tiny link on my main website gives me a bit of pressure to keep it updated. I can imagine you, a listener, as i am writing everything down. 

Another big moment is that i am hosting this on github, which i really do not like. It is entire my personal problem tho. Github is great, but i hate all the add, commit, push, pull. It stresses me out so much. I can probably only hope this publishing can last, together with my patience with git. 

But, I am happy right now as this site is working. Gonna shower and get ready for some work later :)
